# SynthNet — 10/10 Pitch Script

> **Total runtime: ~8–10 minutes** (hackathon judges) or **~15 min** (investor meeting).
> Sections marked *(cut for short version)* can be dropped to hit 5 min.
> **[ACTION]** cues = what to click or show on screen.

## THE FRAMEWORK

Every line follows this structure:
**Hook → Problem → Insight → Solution → Proof → Why Us → Ask**

Don't pitch features. Pitch a world that becomes true because SynthNet exists.

---

## OPENING — 30 SECONDS
**[ACTION]** Be on the landing page. Let the 3D hero spin.

> "Every major AI model — GPT-4, Gemini, Llama — was trained on synthetic data.
> Not scraped text. Not licensed content. Synthetic data.
> The problem? Those pipelines are **private, centralized, and inaccessible** to everyone else.
> SynthNet changes that.
> We are the **first decentralized marketplace for synthetic data** — built as a Bittensor subnet,
> where anyone can request a dataset, miners compete to produce it, and quality is verified on-chain automatically.
> No central operator. No gatekeeping. Just data."

---

## THE PROBLEM — 1 MINUTE

> "Here's what's broken today.
>
> AI teams need massive, diverse, training-grade datasets — but real-world data is either **scarce, private, or locked behind six-figure licensing deals**.
>
> So they turn to synthetic data providers — Scale AI, Gretel, proprietary pipelines.
> But those are **single-vendor, opaque, and expensive**. You don't know how the data was made,
> you can't verify quality independently, and you're completely locked in.
>
> Worse — the volume-incentivized systems that exist today reward **quantity over quality**.
> There's no on-chain accountability. No transparency. No competition.
>
> The demand for synthetic data is exploding. The supply side is broken.
> **That's the gap SynthNet fills.**"

---

## THE INSIGHT — 20 SECONDS

> "Here's the key insight:
> **Data quality is a coordination problem — and Bittensor solves coordination problems.**
> We don't need to build the world's best synthetic data generator.
> We need to build the best **incentive system** for thousands of generators to compete,
> and let on-chain consensus surface the winners.
> That's exactly what a Bittensor subnet does."

---

## THE SOLUTION — 45 SECONDS

> "SynthNet is a Bittensor subnet with three participants:
>
> **Users** — AI labs, researchers, startups — request datasets. They specify type, volume, format, and quality parameters. They get an instant TAO cost estimate.
>
> **Miners** — anyone with compute — compete to produce the best dataset matching that spec.
>
> **Validators** — score output across five axes: spec adherence, diversity, accuracy, coherence, and format — and those scores are **written on-chain, immutably**.
>
> TAO rewards flow automatically to miners and validators proportional to quality.
> No middleman. No platform fee eating 40% margins. Just aligned incentives."

---

## LIVE DEMO — 3–4 MINUTES

### A) Landing page — Network Stats
**[ACTION]** Scroll to the four stat cards.

> "Right now the network shows 15,847 datasets across text, code, and conversations.
> 342 active miners competing for every request. Average quality score of 94.2 out of 100.
> 99.8% uptime — because there's no single server to go down.
> These are the numbers you'd see from the live Bittensor chain."

---

### B) Request Flow
**[ACTION]** Click **Request Data** in the nav.

> "Let me show you the core user flow.
>
> I want TypeScript code completions for a fine-tuning run.
> Step one — I pick the data type: Code.
> Step two — I set my spec: topic, quantity — say 10,000 samples — JSONL format,
> high diversity, moderate creativity.
>
> **[ACTION]** Advance steps as you speak. Land on the summary/cost estimate.
>
> Instantly I get a TAO cost estimate. I submit — and miners across the subnet
> start competing to fill this order in real-time.
> The best output, scored by validators, is what I receive.
> I don't pick the miner. The protocol does. That's the point."

---

### C) Dashboard
**[ACTION]** Click **Dashboard**.

> "Operators and miners can watch the network in real-time here —
> quality trends, active generation queue, top miners by performance.
> The radar charts break down quality dimensions per miner.
> Think of this as the Bloomberg terminal for synthetic data infrastructure."

---

### D) Marketplace
**[ACTION]** Click **Marketplace**.

> "Don't need a custom dataset right now? Browse the marketplace.
> Verified datasets are available for immediate download — each one tagged with its quality score.
> One click previews the sample; the next downloads the full file.
> Every purchase comes with an on-chain quality attestation — **immutable proof** of what you bought."

---

### E) Miner Explorer *(cut for short version)*
**[ACTION]** Click **Miner Explorer**.

> "This is the trust layer made visible.
> Every miner's stake, trust score, rank, and consensus data — transparent and public.
> Delegators can see exactly who to stake behind. Miners have real reputational skin in the game."

---

## THE CORE INNOVATION — 1 MINUTE
*(Deliver this from memory, not reading from a screen.)*

> "The hard part of this problem isn't the frontend.
> It's **making sure quality wins** — and making it impossible to game.
>
> We designed a four-signal quality score:
> — 45% **downstream utility** — hidden benchmarks test whether the data actually improves a model.
> — 25% **human audit score** — random samples reviewed by trusted reviewers.
> — 20% **automated checks** — deterministic schema and format validation.
> — 10% **novelty** — embedding distance to prevent data spam and duplication.
>
> Miners only get credit for their top-K quality outputs per epoch.
> Submitting garbage at volume **does not help you** — it's structurally impossible to spam your way to rewards.
>
> Validators are scored too — against audit anchors. Inaccurate validators lose influence and dividends.
> Benchmarks rotate privately so miners can't overfit the metric.
>
> **Quality over volume — baked into the protocol, not bolted on.**"

## MARKET OPPORTUNITY — 30 SECONDS *(cut for short version)*

> "The TAM is the $2.3 trillion global AI market by 2030.
> The SAM — data services, labeling, synthetic data — is $800 billion.
> Our immediate serviceable market — synthetic data generation specifically — hits **$12 billion this year**.
>
> Every AI company is a potential SynthNet customer.
> GPT-4, Gemini, Llama — all trained on synthetic pipelines.
> We're not chasing a niche. We're building **infrastructure for the entire AI data economy**."

---

## COMPETITIVE MOAT — 20 SECONDS

> "Scale AI — centralized, expensive, closed.
> Gretel.ai — centralized, API-only, no on-chain verification.
> Hugging Face — open access to existing data, but no generation marketplace.
>
> **SynthNet is the only platform that combines decentralized supply,
> on-chain quality proofs, permissionless access, and TAO incentives.**
> That combination is not reproducible without Bittensor."

---

## WHY NOW — 15 SECONDS

> "The timing is perfect.
> Every frontier lab just hit the wall on internet-scale training data.
> Synthetic data is no longer optional — it's the only path forward.
> Bittensor is live, the incentive model is proven, and we have a production-ready frontend.
> **We're not early. We're exactly on time.**"

---

## THE ASK / CLOSE — 30 SECONDS

**[ACTION]** Return to the landing page. Hero spinning. Pause for effect.

> "SynthNet is building the decentralized backbone for the global AI data economy.
>
> The frontend is production-ready — you've seen it.
> The incentive design is spec'd — it's in our docs.
> Next: live subnet registration, first 10 miners onboarded, validator scoring live.
>
> We're looking for *(investors: 'a seed round of $X to fund subnet launch and the first enterprise partnership')* / *(hackathon: 'your feedback — especially on incentive design')*.
>
> If you believe AI needs open data infrastructure the way the internet needed open protocols —
> **SynthNet is how that gets built.**
>
> Questions?"

## HANDLING TOUGH QUESTIONS

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **Is this live?** | "The frontend is production-ready — you've used it. The subnet design is fully spec'd. Next milestone is live Bittensor registration and first miner cohort. We're shipping." |
| **Why won't miners just produce junk?** | "Structurally impossible. Top-K concave scoring means volume doesn't help. 45% of the score is downstream utility on **hidden** benchmarks they can't overfit. Junk earns zero." |
| **Why can't validators collude?** | "Validators are scored against independent audit anchors. Collusion shows up immediately as a deviation from anchors — they lose influence and dividends. Multi-validator redundancy per task (≥3) means any one bad actor is outvoted." |
| **Why Bittensor and not Ethereum/Solana?** | "Bittensor is the only L1 purpose-built for decentralized AI incentives. TAO emissions, miner/validator roles, consensus scoring — it's native. Solana/Ethereum would require us to rebuild all of that from scratch." |
| **What's stopping a big lab from doing this internally?** | "They already are — and it's their competitive moat. We're building the open version. The same way AWS lost to open-source infra in certain categories, a permissionless marketplace wins on price, diversity, and accountability." |
| **How do you monetize?** | "Protocol fee on dataset purchases, retained from each TAO transaction. Enterprise API tier for direct access at scale. As transaction volume grows, the fee pool is self-sustaining." |
| **What's the team?** | *(Answer with your actual background — lead with technical credibility and any Bittensor/ML experience.)* |

## DELIVERY NOTES

1. **Speak to one person at a time.** Eye contact. Not at the screen.
2. **The 3D hero is your secret weapon.** Let it run while you talk — judges remember visual demos.
3. **Don't apologize for mock data.** Say "production-ready frontend" with confidence. This framing is accurate and strong.
4. **Slow down on the quality score formula.** It's complex. Pause after each signal. Let it land.
5. **The close is a statement, not a question.** "SynthNet is how that gets built." Full stop. Then ask for questions.
6. **If they interrupt for a question mid-demo** — answer in one sentence, then say "let me show you" and go back to the screen.
7. **Rehearse the transition from Request → Dashboard → Marketplace** until it takes under 90 seconds cold.
